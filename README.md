  Main asset allocation: Stocks, Bonds, Gold.
  Allocation weight calculation method: Timing indicators for stocks, bonds, and gold.

  - Timing indicator for stocks and bonds: Utilizing the stock-bond valuation ratio (ERP) and resonance signals generated by stock market volume-price indicators (moving averages + trading volume) to determine whether to increase or decrease positions.
  - Timing indicator for gold: Combining changes in US Treasury bond yields, VIX hedging, and gold price momentum to generate signals for adjusting positions in gold.

### Timing Indicator for Stocks and Bonds
#### Equity Risk Premium indicator
  ERP refers to the difference between the expected returns of the stock market and the bond market. It represents the excess return that investors anticipate from investing in stocks compared to bonds. However, Chinese index valuations are generally lower, and ERP tends to be greater than 0 in the long term. Therefore, the absolute value reference has limited significance. Instead, we adopt the rolling five-year percentile of ERP as an indicator of the relative attractiveness of stocks compared to bonds.
  - [ ] Signal indicator: Five-year percentile of ERP - Index-weighted moving average (window period = 120 trading days). As ERP is a valuation-based indicator, the market may not immediately reverse when ERP is at a high/low level. Therefore, using weighted ERP percentiles for long-term data smoothing is implemented with a default window period of 120 trading days.
  - [ ] Signal generation:
    - [ ] ERP[70%，30%]; Signal[1，0，-1]
    - [ ] Backtesting period: 2010-2022
    - [ ] Signal frequency: Monthly (M)
